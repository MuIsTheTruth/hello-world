# hello-world
This is all new to me
I'll be honest... I have no idea what I am doing. I've had many strange experiences during the last year. Part of it is that I keep being directed towards certain places on the internet. This is one. I feel that nothing is explained clearly on many of these sites. It's like I'm reading a lanuage I should already know, but don't. Yet for some reason I feel that I should. I don't know... but I never give up until I do.
